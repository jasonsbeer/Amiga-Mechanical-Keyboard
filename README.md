# Amiga Mechanical Keyboard
Mechanical keyboard for the Amiga 2000/3000/4000.

This is a project I started while pausing on another project. This IS NOT a drop-in replacment for legacy Amiga keyboards. Rather, it is a new design using Cherry PCB mount switches and off the shelf key caps. I am not planning to work on this at the moment, but I may work on it again in the future. The schematics, PCB layout, and routing are complete (as far as I remember). All that's missing is the code for the STM FPGA.

For a keyboard case, I had planned to prototype using JLCPCB's industrial resin printing. I have started the CAD drawings, but need to upload them.

I thought I would put it out in case anyone found it interesting or wanted to continue development.
